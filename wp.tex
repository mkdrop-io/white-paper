\begin{abstract}
  In the rapidly evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, the distribution of tokens, 
  particularly through airdrops, plays a pivotal role in project promotion 
  and community engagement. However, the current methods for token distribution 
  are fraught with challenges like high transaction costs, security risks, and 
  inefficient processes. This white paper proposes a novel platform designed to 
  streamline and secure the process of token distribution while maintaining the 
  anonymity characteristic of the crypto world.

\section{Introduction}

The rapidly expanding cryptocurrency sector relies heavily on effective token distribution,
crucial for engaging and maintaining community support. This white paper introduces an innovative 
platform designed to optimize token distribution processes, enhance security, and foster authentic 
community growth. Token distribution, essential for allocating digital assets to stakeholders like investors, 
team members, and users, has evolved to reflect the dynamic and complex nature of the cryptocurrency world.

\begin{description}
  \item[Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)]
  Since their emergence in 2013, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have become a favored funding 
  method for crypto projects. Investors contribute assets such as Bitcoin to early developers, 
  receiving tokens in return at the network's launch. This method gained popularity with major projects 
  like Ethereum raising significant funds through ICOs.

  \item[Venture Capital Investment]
  In this traditional approach, venture capitalist firms invest in crypto startups by 
  purchasing their tokens, distinct from typical venture capital which focuses on acquiring company equity.

  \item[Airdrops]
  Airdrops are utilized as a marketing tool to distribute a limited number of 
  tokens directly to user wallets. This strategy is instrumental in increasing awareness 
  of the project and building a network effect.

  \item[Lockdrops]
  Lockdrops are an innovative distribution method where users temporarily lock up their existing 
  tokens before the introduction of a new cryptocurrency. This model is based on the participants' 
  commitment to the new project's success.

  \item[Public Sales]
  This category encompasses methods like Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) and Initial DEX Offerings
  (IDOs). Here, tokens are released into the market through exchanges, offering a decentralized way 
  of distributing tokens.
\end{description}


\section{Challanges}

In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency ventures, the implementation of token vesting schedules is a crucial factor that requires 
thoughtful planning. Once these schedules are embedded in smart contracts, they become permanent. 
This permanence guarantees transparency and fosters trust, but it also adds a degree of inflexibility.
This can be particularly problematic for projects that are still refining their strategies.

\begin{description}
  \item[Challenges to Project Adaptability]
  In the early and frequently changing stages of cryptocurrency projects, the unalterable nature 
  of vesting schedules fixed in smart contracts can cause a disconnect. This misalignment happens 
  between the project's evolving needs and the predetermined plans for token distribution.

  \item[Confidence]
  Stakeholder trust can be deeply affected if there are significant changes in the project's direction
  after the initial token distribution or airdrop. Unchangeable vesting schedules might leave stakeholders 
  feeling unfairly treated, which can impact their continued support and confidence in the project.

  \item[Operational and Strategic Flexibility]
  Rigid vesting schedules can restrict the project team's capability to adjust strategies. 
  This limitation affects various aspects such as modifying the project's scope, extending development 
  timelines, or shifting the project's strategy in response to market feedback, technological developments, 
  or shifts in the project's ecosystem.
\end{description}


\section{Solution}

The "Provisional Token Allocation" approach involves initially reserving tokens 
for users without directly allocating them to their wallets. 

Instead, users are provided with placeholders or "slots" representing their entitlement to tokens. 
These slots remain provisional until certain criteria or milestones are met, at which point 
the tokens are materialized or converted into immutable tokens. 

The criteria for materialization 
can vary, including project milestones, market conditions, or predefined time-based factors. 
This approach offers flexibility in the timing of token distribution.

Keynotes from the process flow:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Token Allocation by Company:} The starting point where the company determines and allocates tokens.
  \item \textbf{Wallet Verification:} Users undergo a verification process to ensure uniqueness. 
  Uniqueness must satisfy only proof of \textbf{one user} == \textbf{one wallet} and not aim to 
  reveal users’ identities.
  \item \textbf{Provision:} Users claim their tokens, resulting in the assignment of ’provisional’ tokens. Such tokens signify a placeholder for future
  and just exist on user wallets as slots.
  \item \textbf{Materialization:} The provisional tokens are materialized into actual tokens. Materialization 
  means linking them from a placeholder contract to a real smart contract, embedding business 
  logic such as vesting and other features. By its nature, this process follows the intuition 
  of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_binding} a well-known concept in software development. 
  \item \textbf{Distribution:} The actual tokens are then distributed to the end users.
\end{enumerate}

Token desctribution at this moment solvels in a different ways: .......
Even though each of them partially solvesl described issues, neither one is perfect.

\subsection{Features}
\label{sec:features}

There are many important qualities and features cryptocomunity expects a airdrop platform to have,
in order to be useful the web3 ecosystem. The most critical \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement}{functional requirements}
are:

\subsection{Non-functional Requirements}
\label{sec:nfr}

The most important \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement}{non-functional requirements} are:

\begin{description}
  \item[Security]
  This is paramount in blockchain systems to protect against fraud, hacks,
   and unauthorized access. Security measures could include multi-factor authentication, 
  encryption, secure smart contract coding practices, and regular security audits

  \item[Scalability]
  The system should be able to handle increasing workloads and 
  accommodate growth in user numbers and transaction volumes. Potential rarer but peak volumes during short timeframe.  
  This might involve off-chain processing claims, optimizing smart contract efficiency,
  considering layer 2 scaling solutions, or implementing sharding techniques

  \item[Cost Efficiency]
  Managing transaction costs, especially on networks with high gas fees, 
  is crucial for both the users and the company. 
  Optimizing smart contract execution and considering gas-efficient 
  algorithms are important in this regard.

  \item[Flexibility]
  System must satisfy main needs of crypto projects in 2 dimentions: 
  token governance and community management.
